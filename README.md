# Brain_tumor_classfication
an image classification deep learning project using CNN

---


##  Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumors from medical imaging using **Deep Learning** techniques. Brain tumors pose serious health risks, and early detection plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate model for automated brain tumor detection.

##  Features

* Preprocessing of MRI images (normalization, resizing, augmentation).
* Deep learning‚Äìbased classification model using CNN.
* Supports multiple tumor classes (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor).
* High accuracy and performance with reduced computational cost.
* Visualizations of training, validation, and test results.

##  Existing Work

* Several research papers have applied CNNs and transfer learning techniques (such as VGG16, ResNet, and Inception) for tumor classification.
* Existing models provide good accuracy but often require **large datasets** and **heavy computation**.
* Many projects lack **explainability** and **visualizations** to assist medical professionals.

##  Presented Work (Our Approach)

* Developed a **custom CNN architecture** optimized for medical image classification.
* Used **data augmentation** to overcome limited dataset challenges.
* Performed **comparative analysis** with transfer learning models (MobileNetV2).
* Implemented **Grad-CAM visualizations** for explainability of model predictions.
* Built a simple **user interface** for uploading and predicting brain MRI images.

## üìä Results

* Achieved **\~95% accuracy** on the test dataset.
* Model outperformed baseline CNN architectures in terms of precision and recall.
* Visualization methods provided meaningful insights into tumor localization.
* Demonstrated a reliable and practical approach for automated brain tumor detection.
